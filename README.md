clepsydra
========

A microservice that will perform actions on a Docker container based on cron schedule.

## Building

`make`

## Running

`./bin/clepsydra`

## Usage

Once `clepsydra` is up and running it watches Docker socket events for `create, start and destroy` events.
If a container is found to have the label `cron.schedule` then it will be added to the crontab based on the schedule.

Cron scheduling rules follow: [Expression Format](https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format)

## Override labels that can be applied

To override the default start action on the container, set the label `cron.action` equal to ``stop` or `restart`.

To override the default 10 second restart/stop timeout set the label `cron.restart_timeout` to the number of
seconds you would like. For instance for 20 seconds: `cron.restart_timeout=20`.

## Examples
```
# Restart every minute
> docker run -d --label=cron.schedule="0 * * * * ?" ubuntu:16.04 date
```
